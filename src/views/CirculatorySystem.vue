                        Circulatory System
                    </h1>
                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The shoebill circulatory system does not deviate much from the typical
                        mammalian circulatory system. Birds have a closed circulatory system with a 4
                        chambered heart and “complete separation of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood” (Ritchison, n.d). In
                        terms of
                        function, the avian heart is identical to the human heart; oxygenated blood enters the left atrium
                        to the left ventricle then through the aorta where it is delivered to rest of the body (Ritchison,
                        n.d). Deoxygenated
                        blood enters the right atrium to the right ventricle where it is delivered to the lungs for
                        countercurrent gas
                        exchange described in the <router-link to="/Respiratory-System" class="text-green-600">Respiratory
                            System's</router-link> page (Ritchison, n.d). The difference between mammals and birds is the
                        size and efficiency of the heart. While
                        birds have smaller hearts than most mammals, they also have a smaller body mass. When body mass is
                        accounted for, birds have a larger heart than mammals (Ritchison, n.d). The larger heart contributes
                        to a higher
                        stroke volume compared to mammals (Ritchison, n.d). Additionally, when a bird is active, their heart
                        can reach 670
                        beats/min whereas most humas struggle to get their heart rate over 200 beats/min (Ritchison, n.d). The higher stroke volume and heart rate allow the shoebill stork to supply it's muscles with enough oxygen to fly.

                    <br>

                    <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Unlike mammals, the red blood cells within a bird
                        have a nucleus (Ritchison, n.d). The lack of a nucleus in mammals is hypothesised to be more efficient because without “cell
                        organelles … erythrocytes [can] pack more haemoglobin into the cells to increase oxygen carrying
                    capacity” (Yap, 2021). This hypothesis would suggest that mammalian red blood cells are more efficient than that
                    of Aves. However, haemoglobin concentration in mammals and avians turn out to be the same when
                    tested (Yap, 2021). These results suggest that avians use a different strategy to pack haemoglobin within their red blood cells and achieve 
                    the same oxygen-carrying capacity as mammals (Yap, 2021). Further reaserch must be done to examine the differences between mammalian and avian red
                    blood cells and their efficiency. </p>
