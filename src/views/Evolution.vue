                    </h1>
                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Shoebills hunt by standing still in water for hours and waiting for pray
                        to pass by. When they see a potential meal, they lung at the pray and catch it with their bill.
                        There are a lot of optimizations that make this strategy effective for shoebills. Firstly, Shoebills
                        are light gray in colour which “may be so that they are less visible to prey looking up from water”
                        (Grzimek, 233). In addition, their long legs give them a height advantage so they can spot fish
                        moving further away and they can hunt in deeper water (Guillet 1979). Their feet are webbed which helps them swim faster and prevents them from
                        sinking into the mud (Guillet 1979). Finally, their enormous sharp bill is specifically adapted for catching lung
                        fish which are very slippery (Whitehouse, 2020). Not much is known specifically about the
                        evolution of shoebill storks. There is still lots of debate whether or not shoebills should be
                        classified as Ciconiiformes or Pelecaniformes though DNA testing points toward Pelecaniformes (Olson
                        1979).

                        Albinism
                    </h1>
                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Albinism is a common genetic trait seen throughout many species. Beside is an image of an albino bird, albino shoebills are very rare and there are very few photographs of them. Albinism affects the production of melanin which gives skin, hair, and eyes colour (nhs, 2020). Without colour, shoebills appear light and are easy to spot. Consequently, albino shoebills are preyed upon more often than shoebills that can blend into their surroundings (Grzimek, 233). Additionally, albino shoebills have more difficulty hunting because they rely on their dark colours to stay hidden above the waters of a swamp, where their prey live (Grzimek, 233). Albinism can also cause eye problems (nhs, 2020). Some eye problems include short-sightedness or far-sightedness, astigmatism which affects the eyes lens causing blurry vision, and nystagmus, where eyes move involuntarily (nhs, 2020). Shoebills very much depend on their sense of sight in order to catch prey, loosing that would make their strategy ineffective (Grzimek, 233). Evolutionarily, the difference in the rate of albino individuals in humans and birds can be explained by this phenomenon. Less melanin does not disadvantage humans and there are corrective lenses for they eye problems that follow. Therefore, there is no selection pressure for humans to get rid of albinism, causing the rate of albinism to affect one in every eighteen thousand people (Cleveland Clinic, 2021). In contrast, there is a massive selection away from albinism in birds for the reasons discussed previously. Thus, it makes sense that only one in every thirty thousand birds exhibit the albino trait (Begazo, n.d).

                    </h1>
                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Flight was a milestone in evolutionary history. It allows birds to
                        escape predators and get places faster. Some scientists think early dinosaurs used wings as a
                        way to assist with running fast or jumping high, shown on the right (Ritchison, n.d). Other scientists suggest that wings were used for
                        assisted tree climbing and gliding back down to the surface (Ritchison, n.d). These dinosaurs could not fly yet
                        however, as dinosaurs became smaller their
                        wings became more useful. This lead to a selection pressure to refine the shape of the wings, develop feathers, create a lighter skeleton and, better the reparatory system (Ritchison, n.d). Current birds have hollow bones which is why the shoebill stork, with a
                        height of 5 feet and a wing span of 2.6 meters, only weigh eleven pounds (National Geographic, n.d). For shoebills, flight is very useful as it allows them to quickly traverse the mushy swamps they live in. However, their large body makes flying for long periods of time very difficult.</p>
