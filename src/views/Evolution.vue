                    </h1>
                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Shoebills hunt by standing still in water for hours and waiting for pray
                        to pass by. When they see a potential meal, they lung at the pray and catch it with their bill.
                        There are a lot of optimizations that make this strategy effective for shoebills. Firstly, Shoebills
                        are light gray in colour which “may be so that they are less visible to prey looking up from water”
                        (Grzimek, 233). In addition, their long legs give them a height advantage so they can spot fish
                        moving further away and they can hunt in deeper water. Their feet are webbed which helps them swim faster and prevents them from
                        sinking into the mud. Finally, their enormous sharp bill is specifically adapted for catching lung
                        fish which are very slippery (Biologydictionary, 2020). Not much is known specifically about the
                        evolution of shoebill storks. There is still lots of debate whether or not shoebills should be
                        classified as Ciconiiformes or Pelecaniformes though DNA testing points toward Pelecaniformes (Olson
                        1979).

                    </h1>
                    <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Flight was a milestone in evolutionary history. It allows birds to
                        escape predators and get places faster. Some scientists think early dinosaurs are used wings as a
                        way to assist with running fast or jumping high, shown on the right. Other scientists suggest that wings were used for
                        assisted tree climbing and gliding back down to the surface. These dinosaurs could not fly yet
                        however, there was a selection pressure to become smaller and as the dinosaurs became smaller their
                        wings became more useful. Current birds have hollow bones which is why the shoebill stork, with a
                        heigh of 5 feet and a wing span of 2.6 meters, only weigh eleven pounds. The wings, small body, and light skeleten allowed birds to take flight off the ground.</p>
