They are very territorial defending areas up to three square kilometers (Steffen, 2007). They typically lay 2 – 3 eggs however, only one usually fledges (Mullers, 2015). Care for the young is shared between parents. They take turns building the nest, which is usually made of grass and is three meters in diameter (Steffen, 2007). Shoebills nest on the ground which is uncommon because birds typically nest in trees to avoid predation. Because shoebills fill a niche in the swamps, they only have to worry about humans and crocodiles as predators. Thus, nesting in trees is not a priority. Once eggs are laid, shoebills will take mouthfuls of water and pour it on the eggs to keep them cool (Steffen, 2007). This process is known as egg-watering and is different from the incubation of eggs other avian exhibit due to the cooler environment. When chicks hatch, parents will take turns feeding them. Children take 95 days to fledge which is when parents stop delivering food (Mullers, 2015). Over the next 35 days, shoebills explore their area and learn to hunt, eventually leaving the nest. (Mullers, 2015). </p></div><div class="lg:max-w-lg lg:w-full md:w-1/2 w-5/6"><a href="\r

This behavior is called siblicide and is a strategy that ensures at least one healthy chick fledges. Shoebills lay and hatch 2 – 3 eggs typically. When resources are abundant, all three chicks can fledge successfully (Mock, 2004). However, when resources become scarce, siblicidal tenancies increase (Mock, 2004). The youngest, most weak chick is usually ruled out first as it does not have the ability to fights its siblings. Additionally, parents will explicitly favour the biggest, most healthy chick giving all their resources to them (Mock, 2004). In a study with two chicks, the eldest chick was unable to eat food and its weight dropped, shown by the top graph, the pecking frequency on the younger chick increased, and the share of food the senior chick got also increased. The youngest child is going to be killed by its siblings or die of starvation, so it seems like a waste of energy to lay that egg. Thus, there should be a selection pressure against it. This selection pressure is not observed because the last egg acts like a fail safe in case the other eggs are infertile or are preyed upon (Mock, 2004). In most other cases, unless there is an abundance of resources which is rare, the third child is set up to fail (Mock, 2004). Thus, silicide ensures the best chance of survival for a clutch of chicks. </p></div></div></section>',2),r=[n];function c(h,d){return t(),s("div",null,r)}const f=e(l,[["render",c]]);export{f as default};
