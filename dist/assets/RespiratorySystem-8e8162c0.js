The avian respiratory system is heavily optimised to accommodate oxygen requirements for flight and the loss of oxygen as altitude increases (Ritchison, n.d). There are two main optimizations that make the avian repiratory system one of the most efficent repiratory systems. Firstly, the avian system has <b>unidirectional flow</b> of air meaning, inspired air and expired air are never mixed (Ritchison, n.d). Secondly, <b>countercurrent exchange</b> allows a concentration gradient of oxygen between blood and air to be maintained (Ritchison, n.d).</p></div></div></section><div class="lg:w-3/5 mx-auto border-b pb-10 mb-10 border-gray-400 sm:flex-row flex-col"></div><h1 class="sm:text-4xl text-3xl font-medium text-center title-font text-gray-900 mb-4">Unidirectional Flow</h1><section class="text-gray-600 body-font"><div class="container px-5 py-24 mx-auto"><div class="flex flex-wrap -mx-4 -mb-10 text-center"><div class="sm:w-1/2 mb-10 px-4"><div class="rounded-lg h-65 overflow-hidden"><a href="https://www.ivis.org/library/recent-advances-veterinary-anesthesia-and-analgesia-companion-animals/inhaled-anesthesia" target="_blank"><img alt="content" style="margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;" class="object-cover object-center" src="'+s+'"></a></div><h2 class="title-font text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Inspiration</h2></div><div class="sm:w-1/2 mb-10 px-4"><div class="rounded-lg h-65 overflow-hidden"><a href="https://www.ivis.org/library/recent-advances-veterinary-anesthesia-and-analgesia-companion-animals/inhaled-anesthesia" target="_blank"><img alt="content" class="object-cover object-center" src="'+o+'"></a></div><h2 class="title-font text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Expiration</h2></div></div><p class="leading-relaxed text-base" style="text-align:center;">Unlike mammals, the air flow within avians is unidirectional which allows all the inspired air to continuously pass through the lungs for gas exchange (Ritchison, n.d). In humans the air is bidirectional which means that fresh air is mixed with used air. For birds to have unidirectional airflow they require two cycles of inspiration and expiration (Ritchison, n.d). In the first cycle of inspiration, air passes through the trachea, and is stored in the caudal and abdominal air sacs (Ritchison, n.d). Gas exchange does not occur in the air sacs. When there is enough air stored in the sacs, expiration occurs which push the air through the lungs for gas exchange to occur (Ritchison, n.d). On the second cycle of inspiration, stale air in the lungs is pushed out into the infraclavicular and cranial air sacs (Ritchison, n.d). Finally, on the second cycle of expiration air is driven out through the trachea and exits the birdâ€™s nostrils (Ritchison, n.d). This process is very efficient as inspired air is never mixed with expired air (Ritchison, n.d). Additionally, there is always air moving through the lungs allowing for continuous gas exchange (Ritchison, n.d).</p></div></section><div class="lg:w-3/5 mx-auto border-b pb-10 mb-10 border-gray-400 sm:flex-row flex-col"></div><section class="text-gray-600 body-font overflow-hidden"><div class="container px-5 py-24 mx-auto"><div class="lg:w-4/5 mx-auto flex flex-wrap"><div class="lg:w-1/2 w-full lg:pr-10 lg:py-6 mb-6 lg:mb-0"><h1 class="text-gray-900 text-3xl title-font font-medium mb-4">Counter Current Exchange </h1><p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Countercurrent exchange means that the blood flows in the opposite direction of oxygen in the parabronchi (Byrne, n.d). This means oxygen rich air that has just entered the lungs encounters blood that is almost fully oxygenated (Byrne, n.d). As the air moves further down the lungs it encounters more deoxygenated blood (Byrne, n.d). In addition, the air becomes more deoxygenated as it moves down the lungs. This mechanism makes sure a concentration gradient of oxygen is maintained (Byrne, n.d). In other words, the concentration of oxygen in the air and the blood never equalises meaning there will always be a flow of oxygen into the bloodstream (Byrne, n.d). In contrast, concurrent flow, where blood and oxygen move in the same direction, equalises quickly and therefore, less oxygen can be delivered to the bloodstream (Byrne, n.d).</p></div><a target="_blank" href="https://www.glowm.com/section-view/heading/Placental%20Physiology/item/195"><img alt="" style="width:fit-content;" class="lg:w-1/2 w-full lg:h-auto h-64 object-cover object-center rounded" src="'+r+'"></a></div></div></section>',6),d=[c];function h(m,g){return t(),i("div",null,d)}const f=e(l,[["render",h]]);export{f as default};
