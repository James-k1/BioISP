After a Shoebill swallows their food, it travels down the esophagus and into the <b>crop</b>. The crop is an organ not seen in mammals. It is a pouch used to store food and can deliver food to the shoebills young (Brirannica, 2023). The food then moves into the <b>proventriculus</b>, which is a thick tube analogous to the stomach in humans (Ritchison, n.d). The proventriculus is composed of three layers: the outer muscle tunic, glandular tissue, and the inner mucous membrane layer (Ritchison, n.d). Like mammals, the proventriculus secretes hydrochloric acid and pepsin to break down food and to digest protiens (Ritchison, n.d). The food is now soft however, it was swallowed whole, so it needs to be pulverised. The food moves into the <b>gizzard</b>, shown below, which is like the teeth in mammals. The gizzard has powerful muscles that contract to crush food (Ritchison, n.d). The inside of the gizzard is hard and has ridges which helps grind the food (Brirannica, 2023). The next part of the digestive system is identical to the digestive system in mammals. The food passes through the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. Hormones like trypsin, lipase, amylase, and insulin are produced here like in mammals (Ritchison, n.d). The chyme moves through the rest of the small intestine where the nutrients are absorbed. Finally, the large intestine stores the indigestible material before it is excreted. </p></div><div class="container" style="width:25%;height:25%;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizzard" target="_blank"><img class="object-cover object-center rounded" alt="hero" src="'+n+'"></a></div></div></section>',1),h=[r];function c(l,d){return t(),s("div",null,h)}const u=e(a,[["render",c]]);export{u as default};
