The lack of a nucleus in mammals is hypothesised to be more efficient because without “cell organelles … erythrocytes [can] pack more haemoglobin into the cells to increase oxygen carrying capacity” (Yap, 2021). This hypothesis would suggest that mammalian red blood cells are more efficient than that of Aves. However, haemoglobin concentration in mammals and avians turn out to be the same when tested (Yap, 2021). These results suggest that avians use a different strategy to pack haemoglobin within their red blood cells and achieve the same oxygen-carrying capacity as mammals (Yap, 2021). Further reaserch must be done to examine the differences between mammalian and avian red blood cells and their efficiency. </p></div></div></section>',1);function v(_,w){const a=o("router-link");return r(),i("div",null,[e("section",m,[e("div",u,[e("div",f,[g,e("p",b,[t("The shoebill circulatory system does not deviate much from the typical mammalian circulatory system. Birds have a closed circulatory system with a 4 chambered heart and “complete separation of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood” (Ritchison, n.d). In terms of function, the avian heart is identical to the human heart; oxygenated blood enters the left atrium to the left ventricle then through the aorta where it is delivered to rest of the body (Ritchison, n.d). Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium to the right ventricle where it is delivered to the lungs for countercurrent gas exchange described in the "),n(a,{to:"/Respiratory-System",class:"text-green-600"},{default:l(()=>[t("Respiratory System's")]),_:1}),t(" page (Ritchison, n.d). The difference between mammals and birds is the size and efficiency of the heart. While birds have smaller hearts than most mammals, they also have a smaller body mass. When body mass is accounted for, birds have a larger heart than mammals (Ritchison, n.d). The larger heart contributes to a higher stroke volume compared to mammals (Ritchison, n.d). Additionally, when a bird is active, their heart can reach 670 beats/min whereas most humans struggle to get their heart rate over 200 beats/min (Ritchison, n.d). The higher stroke volume and heart rate allow the shoebill stork to supply it's muscles with enough oxygen to fly. ")])]),y]),x]),p])}const R=s(d,[["render",v]]);export{R as default};
